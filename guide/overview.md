# Overview

## Magic behind the scene
RevoGrid is a cutting-edge virtual data grid component built on top of StencilJS (a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components), leveraging the power of a reactive DOM to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness. Its architecture is designed to handle large datasets with ease, providing a seamless user experience even in data-intensive applications.

This approach allows RevoGrid to be framework-agnostic, ensuring developers can integrate it into any project regardless of the underlying technology stack.


#### Leveraging Reactive DOM

At the core of RevoGrid's high performance is its use of a reactive DOM model. This model ensures that only the parts of the grid that need updating are re-rendered, rather than the entire grid. This selective rendering mechanism is crucial for handling large amounts of data, as it significantly reduces the amount of DOM manipulation required, leading to smoother scrolling and interactions.
