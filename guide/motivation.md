# Motivation

Our journey began nearly two decades ago, amidst the complexities of html5 game development. We were tasked with rendering enormous data chunks, constantly pushing the boundaries to deliver optimal performance to our end-users. This challenge was our first encounter with handling big data, setting the stage for our future endeavors.

As we transitioned into data analysis, the stakes became even higher. Confronted with vast data streams, we quickly realized the limitations of existing solutions. While 3rd-party libraries offered temporary respite, they came with their own set of challengesâ€”prompting us to think beyond conventional methods.

We envisioned a truly reactive data grid core, one that could stand shoulder to shoulder with any framework while being universally accessible. Our goal was to create a solution not just for the challenges we faced but for anyone who might encounter similar hurdles.

`RevoGrid` is our contribution to this vision. As an open-source, MIT-licensed project, it embodies our commitment to providing a powerful tool for developers and organizations alike. It's designed to handle the most demanding data without compromising on performance, ensuring that your applications run smoothly and efficiently.
