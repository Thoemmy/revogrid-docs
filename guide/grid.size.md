# Grid width/height

Working with other grid systems you probably looking for a way to setup width or height for grid viewport.
Good news it'll be updated automatically. All you have todo just change size of your grid with css.

Be aware that there is a min-height of 300px in grid. It's just to avoid the grid to be too small.
