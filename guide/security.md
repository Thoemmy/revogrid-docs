## Security

üõ°Ô∏è **RevoGrid** is a JavaScript library designed to ensure your application meets your security requirements. Here‚Äôs how RevoGrid handles security policies and recommendations for configuring them:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

The basic information on Content Security Policy can be found on the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### Security Vulnerability Testing

Applications using RevoGrid may need to pass security tests before production deployment. RevoGrid is tested for a variety of security vulnerabilities using the SonarQube automatic security testing tool. SonarQube evaluates security using well-established standards such as CWE, SANS Top 25, and OWASP Top 10.

#### SonarQube Results

The SonarQube security test results for our main NPM packages are available, ensuring that RevoGrid maintains high security standards.
