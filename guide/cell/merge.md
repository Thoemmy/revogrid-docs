# Cell Merge in RevoGrid Pro

The Cell Merge feature in RevoGrid Pro allows you to combine adjacent cells into a single, larger cell, much like Excel's merge functionality. This feature is particularly useful for creating headers that span multiple columns or rows and for visually grouping related data within your grid. 

### Why Use Cell Merge?

Cell Merge is a powerful tool that can help you:

- **Create Merged Headers**: Design headers that span across several columns or rows, making it easier to categorize and organize related data.
- **Group Data Visually**: Highlight or group related data by merging cells, which improves the readability and interpretability of your grid.

### Example Use Cases

- **Merged Headers**: Combine cells to create a single header that covers multiple columns. This is ideal for providing overarching categories or labels for grouped columns.
- **Data Grouping**: Use cell merging to visually segment related data or to emphasize specific sections of your grid.

### How It Works

The Cell Merge feature enables you to specify which cells should be merged into a larger cell. This larger cell will span across multiple columns and/or rows. The content of the merged cell will be centrally displayed, enhancing the layout of your grid.

Since this is a Pro feature, ensure that you have access to the Pro version of RevoGrid to utilize this functionality.

### Getting Started

To implement the Cell Merge feature, you'll need to configure it through your gridâ€™s column or row definitions. Below is a step-by-step guide to setting up cell merging.

#### Example Configuration

```javascript
// Define the columns for your grid
const columns = [
  { name: 'ID', prop: 'id' },
  { name: 'Category', prop: 'category' },
  { name: 'Item', prop: 'item' },
  { name: 'Price', prop: 'price' }
];

// Initialize RevoGrid with Pro features enabled
const grid = document.querySelector('revo-grid');
if (grid) {
  grid.columns = columns;
  grid.source = [
    { id: 1, category: 'Fruits', item: 'Apple', price: 1.2 },
    { id: 2, category: 'Fruits', item: 'Banana', price: 0.5 },
    { id: 3, category: 'Vegetables', item: 'Carrot', price: 0.7 }
  ];

  // Define the cell merge configuration
  const cellMerge = [
    {
      row: 0,        // Starting row of the merged cell
      column: 0,     // Starting column of the merged cell
      rowSpan: 2,    // Number of rows the cell spans
      colSpan: 2,    // Number of columns the cell spans
      rowType: 'rgRow',
      colType: 'rgCol',
    },
  ];

  // Apply cell merge settings to the grid
  grid.additionalData = {
    cellMerge,
  };
}
```

In this example, the `cellMerge` configuration merges cells starting from row 0, column 0, spanning 2 rows and 2 columns. Adjust these parameters to fit your specific grid layout requirements.

### Conclusion

The Cell Merge (Column/Row Span) feature in RevoGrid Pro offers an advanced way to enhance the layout and organization of your data grids. By merging cells, you can create cleaner headers and visually group data, improving the overall readability and usability of your grid. Ensure you have access to RevoGrid Pro to leverage this feature and explore its powerful customization capabilities.
