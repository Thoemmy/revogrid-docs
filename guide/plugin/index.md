RevoGrid offers a powerful and flexible plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality. By creating custom plugins, you can add new features, modify existing behavior, and integrate RevoGrid with other libraries or frameworks.

## Creating a Plugin

All plugins in RevoGrid extend from the `BasePlugin` class, which provides a minimal starting core and utility methods for working with the RevoGrid component.

### BasePlugin Class

The `BasePlugin` class serves as a foundational layer for creating plugins. Here's an overview of its interface and capabilities:

<!--@include: ./base.md-->

### Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: When a plugin is created, it initializes with references to the RevoGrid component and its providers.
2. **Event Subscription**: Plugins can subscribe to RevoGrid events using `addEventListener`.
3. **Property Watchers**: Plugins can watch for property changes using `watch`.
4. **Event Emission**: Plugins can emit custom events using `emit`.
5. **Cleanup**: Plugins should clean up their subscriptions using `clearSubscriptions` and `destroy` methods.


### Dispatching Events
<!--@include: ./dispatcher.md-->

### Example Plugin

<!--@include: ./example.md-->



## Plugin Providers

For more advanced plugins, you might need to interact with these providers directly.
The `PluginProviders` type includes several providers that give access to different parts of RevoGrid's internal state:

<!--@include: ../parts/providers.md-->

## Conclusion

The RevoGrid plugin system provides a powerful way to extend and customize the grid's functionality. By leveraging the `BasePlugin` class and the provided utility methods, you can create robust plugins that enhance the capabilities of RevoGrid.
