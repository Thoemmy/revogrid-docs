# Lifecycle Hooks

For detailed interactions and operations, Revogrid provides a variety of events that function similarly to lifecycle hooks, allowing developers to listen and respond to different stages and actions within the grid's lifecycle. Here's a brief overview of some key events Revogrid supports, which can help in managing grid behavior, data manipulation, and user interactions:

### Source
- **`before-any-source`**: Triggered before data application.
- **`after-any-source`**: Fires after all rows are updated.
- **`before-source-set`**: Fired before data source application.
- **`after-source-set`**: Occurs after rows are updated.
- **`before-trimmed`**: Triggered before trimmed values are applied.
- **`after-trimmed`**: Notifies when trimming is applied.

### Column
- **`before-column-applied`**: Happens before columns are applied.
- **`before-columns-set`**: Triggered before column updates.
- **`after-column-resize`**: Occurs after a column resize operation.
- **`after-columns-set`**: Fired when columns are updated.

### Edit
- **`before-edit`**: Triggered before an edit is applied.
- **`before-range-edit`**: Occurs before a range edit is applied.
- **`before-autofill`**: Fired before autofill operation.
- **`after-edit`**: Executes after an edit action is completed.

### Focus/Selection
- **`before-cell-focus`**: Occurs before cell focus changes.
- **`before-focus-lost`**: Happens before grid focus is lost.
- **`after-focus`**: Fires after focus render is completed.

These grouped events provide a structured approach to handling Revogrid's functionalities, making it easier to implement and manage complex data grid behaviors in web applications.
